# Task Tower System Specification

## 1. System Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
Task Tower is a web-based game management system that enables real-time collaboration and task management for multiplayer games. The system uses Google Sheets as its backend data store to provide reliable and scalable data persistence.

### 1.2 Scope
The system consists of:
- Client Application: React-based frontend for game management
- Server Application: Node.js/Express server for API endpoints
- Google Sheets: Data storage and synchronization layer

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Game Management
- Create and manage game sessions
- Track game state in real-time
- Support multiple game modes
- Handle game events and actions

### 2.2 Task Management
- Create, assign, and track tasks
- Support different task types
- Track task progress and status
- Handle task dependencies

### 2.3 Player Management
- Player authentication and authorization
- Track player statistics
- Manage player roles and permissions
- Handle player interactions

### 2.4 Real-time Synchronization
- Real-time game state updates
- Real-time task updates
- Real-time player updates
- Conflict resolution

## 3. Technical Requirements

### 3.1 Client Application
